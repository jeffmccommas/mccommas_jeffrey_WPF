// How many filet's in one Beef Tenderloin and there weight for each guest

/*Basic calculator that will determine how many steaks you will get out of a beef tenderloin. It will calculate the total weight of a the beef tenderloin, the weight of the fillets you want and then calculate the waste or trim and return the total amount of steks you will get from the meat.
